1. What is ARIIMA?ARIMA stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average
ALso understand what being stationary 
if possible also try to understand how to identify whether a graph is stationary or not


So what is a stationary graph?
- there should be no seasonality in the graph - easy to check for a pattern
- the mean should be constant - if it is equally divided with the axis
- standard deviation of the graph should be constand - this you can check if the spread of the data is constant

in teh graph that we have obviously being a rainfall graph we can see some kind of seasonality
heance it is a non staionary data and we have to convert it into stationary data
2. Understanding the dataset that i have

following the instructions given below

3. here we use the ARIIMA model
ARIIMA(p, d, q)
The parameters of the ARIMA model are defined as follows:

p: The lag order, representing the number of lag observations incorporated in the model.
d: Degree of differencing, denoting the number of times raw observations undergo differencing.
q: Order of moving average, indicating the size of the moving average window

ultimately its about tweaking these parameters to reduce the error 
also after you finish this try to understand what each of them do and why this is such an efficinet model
